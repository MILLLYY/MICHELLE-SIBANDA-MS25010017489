1.The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked documents and other 
resources,connected via hyperlinks that are accessed over the internet.
 It is a global information system that allows access to 
documents and we resources over the internet.
2.The difference between a Web application's front-end and back-end is 
that the front-end is what the users see and interact with,everything 
from text and images to forms and buttons.The bacK-end is responsible 
for handling the main processing tasks interacting with the database,
handling complex computation and managing user authentication.So 
basically frontend is the face of the application where users interact
 while the back end is the engine room that powerfully drives the 
 application through  the processing data.
3.This is what occurs on the backend during a web interaction,your
 browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.The sever processes 
 the request,possibly passing it through middleware for tasks like
  authentication.It the executes business logic and interacts  with 
  the database if neccessary.The server formats the data ,creates an 
  HTTP response,and sends it bact to upur browser.Finally,your browser
   recieves the response and updates the display accordingly.This 
   process ensurs smooth interaction between you anf the web application.
4.the MERN stack is a combination of technologies used to create a web
 application.It consists of MongoDB,Express.js,React.js and Node.js, 
 which the word MERN is derived from.Each letter represents a different
  technology and when combined they create a full-stack development
   environment.Together they provide a powerful and efficient way
    to develop mordern we applications fron-front end to back-end.
